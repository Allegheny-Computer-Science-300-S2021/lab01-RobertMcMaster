## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool: Next-generation sequencing

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 This method is used for accurately evaluating of genomic sequences of data.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This method has revolutioned the deepness of biomedical sciences by more effectively
 identifying pathogens.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 I believe this method was necessary to develop because it allows for scientists to obtain
 pathogen sequences faster which can result in a medicines being developed faster.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 One undesirable consequence that could result from the misuse of this tool is that although it is faster and more efficient, it could be less acturate because it is newer.

### Second Tool: Computer aided drug design

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
This tool is used to aid the bioinformatics field in designing drugs.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool uses algorithms, computer programs, and other tools to evaluate
 chemical interaction relationships and design compounds in order to aid drug designers.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 I think this tool was necessary to develop in order to speed up drug production as well as
 decrease cost.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 One undesirable consequence that could result from the misuse of this method is that it
 could be used to design more variants of a drug than neccessary, thus resulting in
 competition and a push to prescribe said drugs more which could result in overprescribing.
